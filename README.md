This repository contains the files and data to run analysis presented in   
Lavallee et al. (submitted 2023), 'Land management shapes drought responses of dominant soil microbial taxa across grasslands'. Specific data used to create each figure in the main text and supplemental file is also provided in 'Source Data.xlsx'

To run the analysis, download all of the files to one folder and run  
Lavallee et al 2023 main code.R  
Note: make sure you setwd() to the location on your machine with the files.  

Lavallee et al. 2023 Resist Resil code.R is slow and cumbersome (sorry). If the package versions  
on your machine are different from when the code was originally run, it may result in slight  
differences in results or errors that prevent the code from running smoothly. I have included  
the results file that the code originally produced so that the remainder of the analysis can be  
run using the same results I used. But I have provided the original code so that it can be reviewed.
